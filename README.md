FPGA implementation of the Apollo Guidance Computer
---------------------------------------------------

Leaning heaviliy on the excellent work of Mike Stewart (see https://github.com/virtualagc/agc_simulation), this
repository contains my first experiments in Verilog and FPGA programming. In the end, I hope to produce a 
working FPGA implementation of the AGC.
